# Discussions Guidelines

Welcome to the WinCC OA Tools Package discussions. This document explains how we use GitHub Discussions and the expected behaviour when participating.

Purpose

- Use Discussions for high-level design conversations, feature requests that need community feedback, usage examples, and non-bug Q&A.
- Use Issues for actionable, trackable tasks, bug reports, and work that will be scheduled and assigned.

Categories and when to use them

- General: Community chat, project-wide announcements and soft coordination.
- Q&A: Usage questions, how-to's, and troubleshooting where answers are useful to others.
- Ideas: Feature proposals and enhancement discussions. Create an Issue only when the feature is agreed and ready to be tracked.
- Show and Tell: Demos, screenshots and short videos that show how you use the tools.

Be respectful. Treat maintainers and contributors with courtesy.

Rules of engagement

- Keep discussions constructive and on-topic.
- Use code blocks for snippets and make them copyable.
- If a discussion yields a concrete task, create an Issue linking back to the discussion.
- Avoid posting large binary files; provide links to external hosting if needed.

Moderation

- Moderators and maintainers may move items from Discussions to Issues when they become actionable.
- Off-topic, abusive or spammy content may be removed.

Getting help

- Search existing discussions before opening a new topic.
- If you need private help, consider contacting a maintainer directly.

Thank you for contributing to a welcoming community!
