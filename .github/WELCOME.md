## 🧭 How to Get Started

### 1. Explore the Ecosystem  
Each repository focuses on a specific part of the WinCC OA developer experience.  
Feel free to browse, read, and get inspired.

We love new ideas — big or small.  
Use the issue templates to propose features, integrations, or improvements.

👉 **New Issue**  
https://github.com/winccoa-tools-pack/.github/issues/new/choose

Every new issue starts with the `triage` label so we can review it together.

## 🛠 How We Work

We keep things structured but lightweight:

- All ideas go through **triage**  
- Large ideas become **projects** with clear plans  
- Small ideas go directly to the right repository  
- Contributors can pick up approved issues anytime  
- Documentation and DevOps improvements are always welcome  

If you’re new, start with issues labeled:

- `good first issue`  
- `help wanted`  
- `approved`
