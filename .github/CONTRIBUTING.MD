# 🤝 Contributing to the WinCC OA Tools Pack

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **winccoa-tools-pack** ecosystem!  
This organization is built by and for the community — and every idea, improvement, and discussion helps shape the future of WinCC OA development.

This guide explains how to propose ideas, how triage works, and how features move through the ecosystem.

---

# 🧭 1. Before You Start

Please review:

- **Issue Templates** (required)  
- **Triage Guide** (required):  
  https://github.com/winccoa-tools-pack/.github/blob/main/docs/triage-guide.md  
- **Code of Conduct** (required)  
- **README files** in the relevant repositories  

This ensures your contribution fits smoothly into the workflow.

---

# 📝 2. Creating an Issue

All new issues **must** use one of the provided templates:

- VS Code extension idea  
- GitHub Actions / CI-CD enhancement  
- WinCC OA testing feature  
- WinCC OA AI feature  
- Integration / sub-project proposal  
- Jenkins idea  
- Documentation request  
- General idea / vision  

Every new issue **automatically receives the `triage` label**.  
This means the issue is waiting for review by maintainers or contributors.

---

# 🧪 3. The Triage Process

The triage team reviews new issues regularly and assigns one of the following outcomes:

### ✔ **Approved → becomes a project**  
For large, multi-step, cross-repository features.

### ✔ **Approved → moved to a child repository**  
For small, isolated tasks that don’t need a project.

### ✔ **Needs more info**  
The issue is unclear or incomplete.

### ✔ **Rejected**  
Not aligned with the ecosystem vision.

# 🗂️ 4. When an Issue Becomes a Project

A project is created when:

- The feature is large  
- Multiple contributors are expected  
- Multiple repositories are involved  
- A roadmap is needed  

### Every project must include:

1. **A Project Plan issue**  
   - Summary  
   - Why this matters  
   - Scope  
   - Out of scope  
   - Architecture sketch  
   - Steps / tasks  
   - Dependencies  
   - Expected outcomes  

2. **A backlog of issues**  
   Each step becomes its own issue.

3. **A delivery order**  
   Clear sequence of tasks.

4. **Labels**  
   - `project`  
   - `backlog`  
   - `priority: high|medium|low`  

Projects are tracked in **GitHub Projects**.

---

# 🌱 5. When an Issue Goes Directly to a Child Repository

Small feature requests do **not** require a project.

Examples:

- A new VS Code command  
- A small GitHub Action  
- A documentation update  
- A minor integration  
- A single-step enhancement  

These are moved directly into the appropriate repository and labeled accordingly.

---

# 🧩 6. Working on Issues

Once an issue is approved:

- It will be labeled `approved`  
- It may be assigned to a project or repository  
- Contributors can comment to express interest  
- Maintainers may assign the issue  

If you want to work on something, just comment:

> “I would like to take this.”

We welcome new contributors.

---

# 🔧 7. Submitting Pull Requests

This organization uses a **simple PR template** focused on clarity and documentation.

Before submitting a PR:

- Make sure the issue is **approved**  
- Follow the PR template  
- Keep changes focused and minimal  
- Update documentation if needed  
- Do not include unrelated changes  

If your PR relates to a project, link the project plan issue.

---

# 🧱 8. Repository Structure

The organization consists of:

- **VS Code extensions**  
- **GitHub Actions & CI/CD tooling**  
- **AI-assisted development tools**  
- **Testing utilities**  
- **Integrations & sub-projects**  
- **Documentation repositories**  
- **Organizational meta-repo (`.github`)**  

Each repository has its own README and contribution notes.

---

# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 9. Maintainer Responsibilities

Maintainers are expected to:

- Review triage issues regularly  
- Communicate decisions clearly  
- Create projects when needed  
- Keep backlogs clean  
- Support contributors  
- Ensure respectful collaboration
