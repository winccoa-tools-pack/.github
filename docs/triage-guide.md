# 🧭 WinCC OA Tools Pack — Triage Guide

This guide explains how new issues are evaluated, labeled, and routed inside the **winccoa-tools-pack** organization.  
The goal is to keep the ecosystem clean, structured, and contributor‑friendly.

---

# 1. Every new issue starts with the `triage` label

All feature requests, ideas, documentation proposals, and integration concepts **must** begin with:

triage


This ensures nothing enters the workflow without review.

---

# 2. Triage team responsibilities

The triage team (maintainers + contributors) reviews issues regularly and decides:

### ✔ Approve → becomes a project  
For large, multi-step, cross-repo features.

### ✔ Approve → move to a child repository  
For small, isolated tasks.

### ✔ Needs more info  
Label: `needs-info`

### ✔ Reject  
Label: `rejected`

# 3. When an issue becomes a project

A project is created when:

- The feature is large  
- Multiple contributors are expected  
- Multiple repos are involved  
- A roadmap is needed  

Each project must include:

- A **Project Plan** issue  
- A **backlog** of tasks  
- A **delivery order**  
- A **clear goal**  
- A **scope definition**  

---

# 4. When an issue goes directly to a child repository

This applies to:

- Small VS Code extension features  
- Small CI/CD improvements  
- Documentation updates  
- Minor integrations  
- Single-step enhancements  

These do **not** require a project.
