All new issues must use one of the templates provided in:

.gith8b/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/

Available templates include:

- VS Code extension ideas  
- GitHub Actions / CI‑CD enhancements  
- WinCC OA testing features

# 🧭 Triage Workflow

All new issues start in **triage**.

During triage, maintainers decide whether the idea:

### ✔ Becomes a project  
For large, multi‑step, cross‑repo features.

### ✔ Moves directly to a child repository  
For small, isolated tasks.

### ✔ Needs more information  
Label: `needs-info`

### ✔ Is rejected  
Label: `rejected`

# 🗂️ Projects & Backlogs

Large features become **GitHub Projects**.

Each project must include:

- A **Project Plan**  
- A **backlog** of issues  
- A **delivery order**  
- A clear **goal** and **scope**

Project plan template:  
https://github.com/winccoa-tools-pack/.github/blob/main/docs/project-plan-template.md  
*(or wherever you place it)*

Small features skip the project phase and go directly into the relevant repository.
